Welcome to my Github repo. I figured I would toss my site up here so anyone could follow along and observe how I build most websites. If anyone has any questions feel free to reach out and ask.

### Setup
* My computer is a 15" MacBook Pro with a 2GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3, and running Lion.
* I use [MAMP Pro](http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/) to work from my localhost.
* I do most of my editing in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).
* I am using [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) to primary help compile my less into one css file. The more I write JS, it will do the same.
* When I am ready to deploy my lastest code I simiply push to master. I have a service hook that does a `git pull` on my server. I love continuous deployment.

Yours sincerely,<br />
