<p>"The NERD tree allows you to explore your filesystem and to open files and directories. It presents the filesystem to you in the form of a tree which you manipulate with the keyboard and/or mouse. It also allows you to perform simple filesystem operations."</p>

<p>I just finished watching Derek Wyatt's videos on VIM and he mentioned a plugin call <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NERD Tree</a>. I thought I would give you a quick run down of how to install and how to use it. The version we will be talking about today is 4.2.0.</p>

<h3>Install:</h3>

<h4>pathogen.vim</h4>
<p>pathogen.vim is the recommended way to install NERD Tree. So lets talk about that first. Basically pathogen.vim is a super easy way to install plugins and runtimes files. Just copy all three lines and paste this into you terminal.</p>
{% highlight php %}
mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle; \
curl -so ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim \
    https://raw.github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/HEAD/autoload/pathogen.vim
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now you need to add this little line to your vimrc</p>
{% highlight php %}
vim ~/.vimrc
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Add this:</p>
{% highlight php %}
call pathogen#infect()
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This should work, if not please review the README doc on github for other examples. <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen</a></p>

<h3>NERD Tree</h3>

<p>Now that we have pathogen.vim installed it will real easy to install NERD Tree. Just run this line.</p>
{% highlight php %}
cd ~/.vim/bundle
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now all we have to do is a clone from git</p>
{% highlight php %}
git clone https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And there you have it. </p>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>
<p>Now that we have everything install, how do we get around and make it work.</p>

<p><code>:NERDTreeToggle</code> Toggles the vertical NERDTree window on and off.</p>

<p>But honestly, that can be a bunch to typing if you are using it a lot. So lets make a shortcut I learned from Eamon O'Connell. We are going to need to edit our vim config file for this. <a href="http://programming34m0.blogspot.com/2011/04/nerd-tree-file-explorer-with-mac-vim.html">http://programming34m0.blogspot.com/2011/04/nerd-tree-file-explorer-with-mac-vim.html</a></p>

{% highlight php %}
vim ~/.vimrc
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Add this:</p>
{% highlight php %}
&quot; Give a shortcut key to NERD Tree
map &lt;F2&gt; :NERDTreeToggle&lt;CR&gt;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Great, now we no long have to type <code>:NERDTreeToggle</code> every time, we just have to hit fn+F2.</p>

<p>Now some shortcuts to get you on your way.</p>

<h3>Getting around the directory</h3>

<p><code>h</code> <code>j</code> <code>k</code> <code>l</code> navigates around the document</p>

<h4>Lets open some windows</h4>

<p><code>s</code> open new vertical split window<br/>
<code>i</code> open new horizontal spilt window</p>

<p>The next question I had was how do I switch back and forth between NERDTree and the other windows. All window commands start with ctrl+w</p>

<p>
<code>ctrl+ww</code> cycle though all windows<br/>
<code>crtl+wh</code> takes you left a window<br/>
<code>crtl+wj</code> takes you down a window<br/>
<code>crtl+wk</code> takes you up a window<br/>
<code>crtl+wl</code> takes you right a window<br/>
</p>

<h4>Lets open some tabs</h4>
<p>
<code>t</code> open new tab<br/>
<code>T</code> open new tab while staying in current tab<br/>
<code>gt</code> cycle though all tabs<br/>
<code>gT</code> cycle though all tabs (moves to the left)<br/>
</p>

<p>To close any of these tabs to windows you can get out the same way you do in vim.</p>
<p>
<code>:q</code> quit<br/>
<code>:wq</code> write (save) and quit<br/>
</p>

<p>Here is some extras shortcuts and enhancements for NERDtree. These will need to go into you <code>.vimrc</code> file.</p>

{% highlight php %}
vim ~/.vimrc
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Then add this to the file.</p>
{% highlight php %}
"Show hidden files in NerdTree
let NERDTreeShowHidden=1

"autopen NERDTree and focus cursor in new document
autocmd VimEnter * NERDTree
autocmd VimEnter * wincmd p
{% endhighlight %}
