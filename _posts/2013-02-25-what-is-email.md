<p>I really haven't thought about it before, but I can tell you that I pretty much hate it. I have about 100 emails from the past week that I have haven't responded to. To properly respond to everyone it is going to take a least a full day. I will most likely spend a few hours each day responding to those emails and whatever else comes in. Generally I am in my own world building something and never notice that I have a new email. This is where I start the pattern of being behind.</p>
<p>I recently started using <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com">Mailbox</a> and it opened my eyes and made me reimagine email. The first thing I did, after having the app open for 10 seconds, was delete my email signature. Why do I need a signature on my personal email? You already know who I am. Why do we need to be so formal? Why can't we treat this conversation more like a chat message that is straight to the point? Why do we need all the fluff from start to finish? This is not some letter that we write with a quill that is transferred by a horse to arrive at our house days later.</p>
<p>Let's cut the bullshit and get straight to the point. Don't start off by saying "Hey Kennedy,". Don't ask how my day is going (unless you sincerely care). I don't care about your weather. Don't make small talk. Just get to the point. I'd rather have you be direct with me. I would even be happy with bullet points in your email. Let's have a conversation vs sending formal mail back and forth.</p>
<p>Let us change what email is and make it more meaningful. Let us create a dialog. Let us get to the point and make each other's life a bit easier.</p>
