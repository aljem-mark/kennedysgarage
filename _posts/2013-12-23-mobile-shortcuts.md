One of the most repetitive task that I do on my mobile devices is enter in my username and email address. I noticed a lot of people still typing each character in. I would to share how to make your life a little more efficient. On both iPhone and Android devices you can setup keyboard shortcuts. I have the following saved in my settings.

**kg** = kennedysgarage<br/>
**kg@** = kennedysgarage@gmail.com

So when I type "kg" it will automatically change to "kennedysgarage". I have also setup shortcuts for my other usernames that I use frequently. What are some shortcuts that have saved you some time?
