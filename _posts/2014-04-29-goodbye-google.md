<p>A few weeks ago I decided it was time for a change and I am pretty sure everyone saw it coming.</p>
<p>Growing up I was always different from the rest of the kids. A lot of the time I felt very alone and hated that I never fit in. I have always had trouble working for someone else and respecting authority. I never understood why I was such a misfit. Over the years I have tried to conform to the norm and be like everyone else. It has never worked out for me that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I feel alone? Yeah, of course. Welcome to trying to do shit differently&rdquo;</p>

<p>As an entrepreneur life is a roller coaster of huge highs and deep lows. About a year into working on Status Chart I came to a realization that it was not going to do as well I hoped. I fell into a slump and didn’t know what to do next with my life. At the same time I received an email from Google asking me if was interested in exploring new opportunities. Not knowing where else to turn I decided there was no harm to at least talk with them. The recruiters treated me like gold. I never had so much respect from a recruiter in my life. Thanks Tony Chan and the rest of the team for being awesome.</p>
<p>I figured they would quickly realize that I never received a higher education, let alone the fact that I barely graduated high school. I somehow passed a couple phone interviews and made it to a full day of interviews. It was a blast and I met a lot of awesome people. A few weeks later Google called me with an offer with an amazing package. It was so great I actually could not even attempt to negotiate it.</p>
<p>I took the job and everyone was happy, including myself at first. About 3 months in I realized that working for someone else was not who I was, no matter how glamorous those golden handcuffs were. I wasn’t being true to myself and it wasn’t the direction I wanted to go. For the first time in a while I thought to myself, "Fuck, I am going to WORK." I talked with my manager Sarah about this and she tried her hardest to make something work.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, Google is an amazing company to work for and I would highly recommend anyone to apply. You get to work with very intelligent developers and extremely creative designers. They offer amazing benefits and a very competitive salary. Free breakfast, lunch, dinner, and 24/7 snacks. They plan very elaborate off sites and have pretty awesome parties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It’s not you Google, it’s me&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the short 6 months that I was there I have had the pleasure to work on a few different projects within the Drive Team. I am really glad that I could help get Add-Ons launched a few days before I left. Of course I also had a blast breaking it down on the dance floor in Atlantic City, winning best tasting beer, celebrating Google’s 15th Birthday, learning American Sign Language, taking over 30 gLearn courses, parting likes it’s 1999, snowboarding down the slopes, winning 3rd place at an eating competition, making awesome gifs, whiskey fridays, being apart of the NYC Emergency Response Team, playing on the Google basketball team, and spending some quality time with some of the most talented people I know.</p>

<p>Leaving Google was not an easy decision. I talked it over with my wife and she completely understood. She is one of the few people that I feel that “get me”. It’s almost unbelievable how fortunate I am to have such an amazing person in my life that will support me no matter how crazy I am. Thank you Sara for being a huge supporter, a great friend, and a caring wife.</p>
<p>I also want to thank some of the Googlers for making my life a fucking blast while there. Pretty much everyone there was amazing, I want to give a special thanks to the my manager Sarah and a good friend Dom for putting up with me daily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are going to quit Google you better make it worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<small>- Everyone</small>

<p>So what’s next for me? Doing my own thing of course and following that passion. Something I have been wanting to do for a while is build an awesome team and create amazing fucking products. I am excited to announce <a href="http://theronstudios.com/">Theron</a>, a creative studio focused on mobile and wearables.</p>
