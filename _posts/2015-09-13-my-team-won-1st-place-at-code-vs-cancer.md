<p>I am excited to announced that my team <a href="http://circly.org/">Circly</a> won 1st place this weekend at the <a href="http://codersvscancer.splashthat.com/">Code vs. Cancer hackathon</a>. This was one of the most meaningful hackathons I have participated in. Cancer in my family seems inevitable. I happy to hack for a cause that is so close to me.</p>
