<p>A lot of people have been asking me how the new job at WeWork is going. Very typical conversation starter. The simple black and white answer I give them is that "I am not bored yet". The follow up question they ask is "well, are you happy?". Of course I am happy, I am always happy and if I am not I fix it.</p>

<p>The question weather or not I am bored is a lot more important question. When you are bored with something you immediately go onto the next thing.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me WeWork is the prefect situation for my ADHD. I get to work on a millions things both digital and physical, I get to hire, I get to build a team, I solve real problems, I work with very talented people across all departments, I get to teach others, and I get to improve the life's of others.</p>

<p>And on top of all of that I still have time for my own personal projects and have a life outside of work.</p>
