      <h2>So Many Paths</h2>
        <p>I am in a bit of a funk right now and I mostly blame it on not knowing what I want to do with my life or even what I want out of it. I'm happily married, live in an awesome place with a great view, making decent money, and successful in my own eyes. The only real goal I have ever had was to be rich, not to buy things, but to be free.</p>
  <p>The opportunities of life are everywhere. Recently in a job interview I was asked the typical question of "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?". I am sure he was looking for some typical answer, but I told him "Honestly? I don't see how it could get much better". The only realistic thing I could think of was having more money in my bank account or maybe a first child.</p>
  <p>I don't even know what I want to do as a career anymore because of the all the options and I feel as I just started. Do I want to be just a designer, maybe specializes in mobile, be that startup guy that has to handle business things, or maybe something completely different. I enjoy them all and I always want to expand that basic list.</p>
  <p>The greatest thing about our field is that there is always something new to learn and better ways to improve our skills. What do I want to learn and improve on today? iOS design, Quartz Composer, Rails, JavaScript, illustrator, svg, typography, business models, lean methodology, Wordpress, basic spelling &amp; grammar, marketing, taxes, raising money, and everything else in between? I sometimes feel this is also the worse part of our field.</p>
  <p>I ofter wonder if I should be a master of one or a jack of all trades. I think to myself I would love to be a master of a few, but I know deep down I want to know and do everything.</p>
  <p>I am sure this is a normal feeling when someone puts so much pressure on themselves. And I am sure I will get over it. There is so much to do and so much to learn in such a little time. Maybe there is some magic calculation of opportunity cost vs time vs risk vs satisfaction. Or maybe I just need to have another beer.</p>
