            <p>A new bar opened up in Gainesville, FL and it needed a site to reflex its image. To this day this is my favorite bar to go. Great atmosphere, great drinks and an anmazing owner.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.theluxbar.com">The Lux Bar</a> is a bar located in Gainesville, FL. My now wife and I found about the place from some of our close friends. We where told that this new bar/lounge was built for young professionals and we had to check it out. If any one has lived in Gainesville, FL for any amount of time, knows that most of the night life consist of kids that can drink...too much. The first night we where there Steve Nichtberger, one of the owners, welcomed us to his place with open arms. We where forever grateful of his place.</p>
            <p>After sever times of visiting our new favorite place and several conversations later, Steve and I where talking about him not having a website. We meet up the next week at Starbucks and started the process. Steve said that he wanted a simple and clean website and that's all he really said. This web site was all in my hands.</p>
            <p>Lux bar is a two story building in between two other bars in downtown Gainesville, FL. You walk into the place and you feel like you are at home right away. Two bars and two patios, one upstairs and one down. One of the few places that is none smoking! They have a large variety of liquor, beer, and wine. Both bars are made of all wood, recycled wood. Thinking about it everything is recycled, the windows, the tile, and even the marble bar top. Lux has a great team of employees: The owner Steve Nichtberger, part owner Craig Murphy, a handful of wonderful bartender, waiters, bar backs, and even the doorman. </p>
            <h3>Ideas for the site</h3>
            <p>The first thing you notice is all the wood. That's where the base of my inspiration came from. Steve mention that he was a very busy man and wound not have that much time to update his site. This gave me the idea for several of the pages. Like all night clubs, they had to have a gallery, I decided to integrate flickr into the gallery page. This way it was fairly easy for Lux to update the gallery without much knowledge of the inner workings of a website. I also had the great idea for their News &amp; Events page. I thought it would be awesome to integrate <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> for this, that way Steve could update any events going on from sending a text message from his phone. You can't get much easier then this. So I presented my ideas and a moc up of the site and he loved it. I knew I had to have lots of pictures of the bar on the site. So I meet up with Steve on a bright Tuesday afternoon and took a few pictures. The pictures where used on his site and even in some local advertisements. I built the site and showed it to him and it went live the next day.</p>
            <h3>Building the Image</h3>
            <p>We first started our new relationship with each other with just the idea of a website. It has involved into building his business cards, some promotional flyers, and even setting up some social media like FourSquare.</p>
