		<h2>About Me</h2>
	   	<p>Hello, my name Kennedy. I was recently named one of the Most <a href="http://betabeat.com/2012/04/betabeats-spring-2012-most-poachable-players-in-tech/#slide22">Poachable Players in Tech</a>, currently I lead the digital design front at M. Shanken Communications, where I have launched several successful apps and websites including an iPhone app that reached Top 3 in the App Store. I recently co&ndash;founded <a href="http://gradespotter.com">Grade Spotter</a>, a full-featured NYC restaurant inspection guide for the iPhone.</p>
		<p>I have always been passionate about the overall user experience of the product and a keen eye for the details while keeping a clear vision of the big picture. Lately my main focus has been UX design for tablet &amp; mobile applications, however I have designed and launched several successful websites over the past eight years.</p>
		<p>During my off hours I am very active in the startup and hackathon scene. Recently my team <a href="http://kennedysgarage.com/projects/poachbase">PoachBase</a> won second place at one of the world's largest hackathons put on by TechCrunch in NYC. While on the 2011 Startup Bus I was nicknamed "The Machine" for my hard work and dedication. I truly love what I do. There is always something exciting to learn and opportunities to help refine the craft.</p>
		<p>I am also a Root member for <a href="http://www.hackerunion.org/">Hacker Union</a> <small>(fka NYHacker)</small> and a UX designer for 48HOURApps. You can often find me at <a href="http://nyhacker.org/">Hacker Townhall</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mdotHF">Mobile Hackers &amp; Founders</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hackersfounders">Hackers &amp; Founders</a>, <a href="http://www.uxhappyhour.com/nyc">UX Happy Hour</a>, and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ny-tech/">NY Tech Meetup</a>.</p>
		<p>In no particular order, here is a little list of some of my skills: HTML5, CSS3, less, Markdown, Git, XML, JSON, iPhone design, iPad design, Android design, some JavaScript, some jQuery, some ROR, some PHP, some SEO, A/B testing, wireframes, rapid prototypes, and getting things off the top shelf. You can often find me working in Photoshop, Sublime Text 2, CodeKit, Terminal, and Vim. If you want to view my experiences, check out my <a href="/resume">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>.</p>

	    <h2>The History</h2>
		<p>The original Kennedy&#8217;s Garage was open by my grandfather Theron Kennedy, in Lake of the Ozark, Missouri on February 28th, 1941. Granted 1941 was a different time and the business was building cars, nothing has changed as far as working hard. The key to his success was the relationships that he developed with his customers and the community.</p>
		<p>Today I still value those traditions and enjoy the old fashion handshake. The original Kennedy&#8217;s Garage was shut down after the passing of Theron. I later reopened the name and wanted to keep the same values of my grandfather. Since then the family has moved away from building cars, we still have a deep passion for them, but now I build amazing ideas surrounding the internet.</p>
