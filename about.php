    		<p>Hello. My name is Kennedy and I am a UX designer with a main focus on mobile apps. I live in New York City with my wife Sara and two morbidly obese cats.</p>
    		<p>I am currently working at M. Shanken Communications as a Lead UX Strategist. On the side I am a Root member for <a href="http://www.hackerunion.org/">Hacker Union</a> (fka NYHacker) and work for <a href="http://48hourapps.com/">48HOURApps</a> and as a front-end developer for the StartupBus.  I have also started to build my latest side project <a href="http://gradespotter.com">Grade Spotter</a>.</p>
    		<p>I attend a lot of hackatons and I blame it all on The Startupbus. You can often find me at <a href="http://nyhacker.org/">Hacker Townhall</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hackersfounders">Hackers and Founders</a>, <a href="http://www.creativemornings.com/">Creative Mornings</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ny-tech/">NY Tech Meetup</a>. When I am not being a geek I enjoy surfing, swimming, longboard skateboarding, and traveling.</p>
    		<p>I didn't get the nickname of The Machine because I am a slacker. I truly love what I do. There is always something exciting to learn and opportunities to help refine the craft. My main focus has been UX design and front-end development for web, tablet &amp; mobile applications. I always try to learn a little more than just my area of expertise. The main reason for this is communication. It is important to have an understanding of how everyone else works within the project.</p>
    		<p>In no particular order, here is a little list of some of my skills: HTML5, CSS3, less, Markdown, Git, XML, JSON, some JavaScript, some Jquery, being awesome, some ROR, some PHP, some SEO, A/B testing, wireframes, rapid prototypes, and getting things off the top shelf. You can often find me working in Photoshop, Textmate, Terminal, and Vim. If you want to view my experiences, check out my <a href="/resume">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>.</p>

        <h2>The History</h2>
		<p>The original Kennedy’s Garage was open by my grandfather Theron Kennedy, in Lake of the Ozark, Missouri on February 28th, 1941. Granted 1941 was a different time and the business was building cars, nothing has changed as far as working hard. The key to his success was the relationships that he developed with his customers and the community.</p>
		<p>Today I still value those traditions and enjoy the old fashion handshake. The original Kennedy’s Garage was shut down after the passing of Theron. I later reopened the name and wanted to keep the same values of my grandfather. Since then the family has moved away from building cars, we still have a deep passion for them, but now I build amazing ideas surrounding the internet.</p>
