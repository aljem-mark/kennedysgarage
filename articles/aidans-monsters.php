  <h2>Aidan's Monsters</h2>
  <h3>You want to do something good today?</h3>
  <p>With the power of social media I stumbled across the story about 5 year old boy name <a href="http://aidforaidan.wordpress.com">Aidan</a> diagnosed with Leukemia. Aidan is selling his <!--http://www.etsy.com/shop/AidansMonsters-->drawings of monsters to help pay for the medical bills. I just purchased a wonderful piece of art for my office at work. You can read more about him on his <a href="http://aidforaidan.wordpress.com">blog</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Aid-for-Aidan/168065143207856?v=wall">Facebook</a> or you can visit his store at <!--http://www.etsy.com/shop/AidansMonsters-->etsy.</p>
