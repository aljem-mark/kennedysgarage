  <h2>Black T-Shirt</h2>
  <p>So the other day I was reading <a href="http://www.thedesigncubicle.com/2009/01/12-common-photoshop-mistakes-misuses-and-abuses/">12 Common Photoshop Mistakes and Malpractice</a> and one of the items was talking about "Assuming K=100 is Black". This had me thinking on how many different ways you can have the color black. I thought to myself, this would be a cool t-shirt. I came up with design and now just have to figure where to have it printed.</p>
