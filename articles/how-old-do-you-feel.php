  <h2>How old do you feel?</h2>
  <p>Last night someone asked me how old I was. I responded back with &#8220;I am 23&#8230;.I mean 26&#8243;. Now granted I just said the first thing that popped in my head, but that had me thinking why I said it. Did I just forget or was there some other meaning. Of course me over thinking everything I went with the second one.</p>
  <p>As a child I had a pretty shitty life and had a lot more responsibilities then I do now&#8230; believe it or not. I always felt that I was older then everyone one else and I always liked hanging out with the older kids, I just felt as if I was on the same level as them.</p>
  <p>So back to last night, I discovered that I still feel like I am in my early 20&#8242;s. Some of the other people there last night around my age and a little older felt the same way. Is there a point in your life where you start feeling older or do you always just latch on to some roundabout age? I am guessing that it is good to feel youthful as long as your are acting your age. So how old are you and how old do you feel?</p>
