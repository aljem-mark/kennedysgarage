  <h2>I Quit</h2>
  <p>That's right, I quit. I know I have said it before and talked about it many times, but I am really doing it this time. I am quitting freelancing.</p>
  <p>Let me get right into it. I started working at <a href="http://www.mshanken.com">M. Shanken Communications Inc.</a> back in March as a lead UX strategist / front-end developer / designer / tall guy of the office. I went into my interview thinking that this is just another job. I had one interview with <a href="http://twitter.com/mturro">Mike Turro</a>, the Director of Technology, and I knew that he would make one hell of a boss. He is one of the few people in this field that actual get it. I had that one interview and I was at my new desk shortly after.</p>
  <p>After a few weeks of working here and getting to know the rest of the team, I fell in love. I have never had this feeling about a job that I wasn't the boss. My first real task was building an <a href="http://apps.winespectator.com/guide-to-napa-valley.php">iPad app</a> with the very talented <a href="http://twitter.com/rjowens">Richard Owens</a> and working directly with the other member of the <a href="http://www.winespectator.com/">Wine Spectator</a> family. This project really helped me fall in love with the rest of the company. </p>
  <p>To those that know me and asked how I liked my new job were all in shock when I confessed my love. Honestly I have never really liked working for the man. But this <strike>man</strike> company treats me right. </p>
  <p>The vibe of the company is a startup with old money, for the most part. Most of the people I work with come from startups which helps fuel this fire. This feeds my need for the startup world. I am very content with my position right now. I think it fits all of my needs that I long for.</p>
  <p>Don't get me wrong, I will still attend hackathons and conferences, but I am going to limit my attendances to hackathons to a minimal, exclusively hacking with <a href="http://twitter.com/davidykay">David Kay</a>. I will always work on side projects, but I think they will be more influenced by on what is at hand and needed for the <a href="http://twitter.com/MShankenDev">M. Shanken Dev Team</a>.</p>
  <p>I also plan on making more time for my lovely wife, that has been so patient with me over the years. She deserves at least an attentional 15 minutes a day. OK, maybe a bit more.</p>
  <p>What about current projects or clients lined up? I will be terminating them over the next few days. I will point them in the right direction and wish them the best. I know this is a bit crazy, but I feel that this is only right. I fear my new direction is not fair to my clients if I can only give them partial commitments.</p>
  <p>This is my birthday present to myself, which is today. I feel that I deserve to give myself something that will make me happy in the long run.</p>
  <p>Thanks everyone for being so supportive.</p>
