  <h2>NYC Web Design Meetup</h2>
  <p>I just got back from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-web-design/">NYC Web Design Meetup</a> and for the most part I really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to listen to someone I look up to in our community, <a href="http://twitter.com/khoi">Khoi Vinh</a>, speak about "the online news industry, sharing his experience as the design director at NYTimes.com and his insight into web and mobile design"<sup><a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-web-design/events/16034652/">1</a></sup>. You might recognize Khoi from his amazing blog <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/">Subtraction.com</a>. I even got to say hi to him and shake his hand!</p>
  <p>After his amazing speech there was a website design critique by a panel. The website was <a href="http://dinevore.com/">dinevore</a> and was presented by the Founder <a href="http://twitter.com/jeremyhfisher">Jeremy Fisher</a>. I personally thought the site was amazing on both the idea and layout. The panel consisted the brilliant Khoi and some other guys. From what I understand the panel was suppose to give an overall opinion about the site and opinions about the UI/UX. With the exception of Kohi, who gave some very vital feedback, the other guys seemed to be there to hear themselves speak. In my opinion they gave nothing of value. They talked about how it was not like yelp or asked about functions that they should have discovered playing around with the site. Jeremy did an amazing job describing his website&#8217;s function and its purpose form the beginning. Yet the panel seemed not to listen (exception of Kohi), to be honest I don&#8217;t know if they ever played around with the site before they spoke about it. I felt bad for Jeremy after it was over. I won&#8217;t go into details on what was said, you can watch it yourself on&#8230;I will post the link once I find it. Anyways I just want to say everyone should check out his amazing site and sign up for an account. After you sign up you should <a href="http://dinevore.com/users/4292">add me on dinevore</a>.</p>
  <p>I also just want to say that I think Jaron Rubenstein did an amazing job putting this on. I will be looking forward to the next one.</p>
