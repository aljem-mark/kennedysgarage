<h2>PSA: Use a CMS</h2>

<h3>I am now dead inside because of this.</h3>
<p>I was working on a project that did not have a CMS...and they refused to use one. So I had to edit each of these files durning a redesign. You might be asking yourself why did you take on this project. Truth be told I was working for another company at the time and sometimes you just have to do it. This screencast was shot back in 2009. I thought I would share one of my more ridicules experiences.</p>
