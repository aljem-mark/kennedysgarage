<h2>StartupBus 2011</h2>
<p>Sound the trumpets, I made it on the <a href="http://startupbus.com">StartupBus</a>. I can not tell you how overly excited I am to have this opportunity. So you might be asking yourself &#8220;What the hell is the StartupBus?&#8221;. Well follow me along this little journey and I will tell you from start to finish.</p>
<p>We began this story with a simple invite from <a href="http://forrst.me/joeconyers">Joe Conyers III</a> to the StartupBus. When I first got the invite I honestly didn't think much of, partly because I didn't understand what it was for. After several minutes of reading about it my eyes lit up as if Santa Claus him self gave me the invite. I figured I would give it a shot, but no chance in hell would I ever get on this bus. A few days later after submitting my application to the StartupBus I got an email from <a href="http://twitter.com/justinisaf">Justin Isaf</a> for an interview. I almost shat myself. I never even thought I would get this far. I went to the interview, had a cup of ice coffee, caffeine kicked in, was little hyped up, had a great time. I really felt proud of myself and thought I did a pretty good job, but in the back of my mind I still thought there was no way I'm getting on this bus. A few weeks later I get an email titled &#8220;Rejection or Confirmation?&#8221; from Justin and was instantly intrigued. The email was asking if I was wanted to join the team on the StartupBus. I could not believe what I was reading. Have I just been accepted to the StartupBus? No fucking way! At this point I just start skipping around as if I have won a million dollars. I mean a billion because a million isn't cool anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah you still have not told us what the StartupBus is. Hold your horses, did you not just hear my story. I got on!. OK, the StartupBus is&#8230;you guessed it&#8230;a bus. But this bus is magical, well maybe more just like a really awesome bus. The main goal of this bus is to hack something together from start to finish in 48 hours. There is a total of 6 busses one from New York, San Francisco, Cleveland, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. There is 25 people on each bus that are made up of Designers, Developers, PR, Marketing and others. Together we create an idea, build the product, launch the product and then present the project in Austin, TX to a panel of high profile investors.</p>
<p>I know you love the idea just as much as I do. Now that I have this amazing opportunity I need some help from you. My good friend <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mcbryde">Michael Vaughn</a> is going to let me stay with him while I'm down there. but I don't currently have a way back home. I also had to put some money toward getting on the bus, these things aren't cheap. So I need two types of donations.</p>
