<p>I just wanted to share some insights to days before the bus ride. It will help help me remember all the details. </p>
<h4>T-6 Days:</h4>
<p>I start of the day meeting some other Buspreneurs. <a href="http://twitter.com/kristenbyers">Kristen Byers</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/LuDoan">Lu Doan</a> &#038; <a href="http://twitter.com/geeosh">Josh Schwartzman</a>. We are tasked with creating the 2011 StartupBus website, for the most part there is a solid foundation built by <a href="http://twitter.com/duhoang">Du</a>. We have been mostly communicating via <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> &amp; <a href="https://convore.com">convore</a>. We are all kind of just hacking things together at this point and looking over each others wireframes for different parts of the site. Of course I have handed out a few <a href="http://forrst.com/">Forrst</a> invites to a few fellow Buspreneurs. </p>
<h4>T-5 Days:</h4>
<p>Purchased my plane ticket (AUS &#9992; ORD &#9992; LGA) today, so thanks to all my sponsors for that. I also realized that I will be on a bus in 5 day. I do not know if I am mentally prepared for what is about to happen. I am currently just going with the flow and wishing I had nothing else to do but brush up on some skills. All day I keep thinking of everything I need to make this trip happen. I need fonts, patterns, random files, make sure everything is updated, backup and it goes on. I am also helping finish up the 2011 Startupbus site. Late last night we decided to change direction on the overall look of the pages. I am pretty excited for this new change. I have also been building great relationships with the other Buspreneurs which is pretty amazing in itself. </p>
<h4>T-4 Days:</h4>
<p>Today was pretty busy, I had a lot of personal errands that I had to take of. I did go over a my list of things that I think I need to take. Then I went to Best Buy and purchased a 500GB Western Digital My Passport Essential SE (USB 3.0), a 4GB thumb drive, and a little tripod for my video camera. I think these are a pretty essential items to have on a bus.</p>
<h4>T-3 Days:</h4>
<p>Today the Buspreneurs are meeting up at <a href="http://www.nwc.co/">New Work City</a>. The New York team is tasked with building almost everything for the StartupBus. We are building the 2011 website which includes maps, stock market games, feeds and more. We also tasked with building the New York site, which is a given. I am tasked with designing and building out the New York site. Today I got a little more then halfway with the site. It was also great meeting some of the other Buspreneurs and had a chance to prove myself.</p>
<h4>T-2 Days:</h4>
<p>We meet up again at <a href="http://www.nwc.co/">New Work City</a>. I finish with the design and coding for the New York site and handed it over to the Ruby guys to help convert it over so we are able to plug the other elements into it. Today was a good day in the office for finishing up a few projects. It was nice that the other buses helped us out today with some of the features.</p>
<h4>T-1 Days:</h4>
<p>I am so excited for tomorrow to happen. Tonight all the NYC Buspreneurs are going to meet at <a href="http://dogpatchlabs.com/">Dogpatch Labs</a> to mix and mingle. I am excited to bring Sara with me to meet the rest of the crew (I said &#8220;crew&#8221; Justin). I still can&#8217;t believe any of this is happening. </p>
<p>Some last minute thoughts. I think I am pretty prepared. I wish I had more time to work on the NYC site &#038; national site. I hope I can remember to bring everything on the bus. I will miss my wife, but not the cats. I also want to sent a big thank you to all my sponsors! I also have some extra <a href="http://forrst.com">Forrst</a> invites to hand out, let me know if you want to be apart of the community. </p>
