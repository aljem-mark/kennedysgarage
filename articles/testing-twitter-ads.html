<p>I was recently invited by <a href="https://ads.twitter.com/">Twitter Ads</a> to promote my account. The offer was to try it without spending a dime with $50 in free advertising. I thought I would share the experience.</p>

<p>First off I think this is a great avenue for Twitter to explore and I think they doing it right so far. Lets think about what they are trying to do. They tell me that they will give me $50 to try it out, but what is really happing here is that they are paying me to collect all my information, including my credit card details. I can only imagine the thought behind this is at some point down the road they can make incentives for me to advertise with my own money. My natural thought will be it worked in the past, it was dead simple, and they already have my information.</p>
<p>Setting up the account was very easy and quick. Choose your location, how much you want to spend per day, setting up promoted tweets, and payment information. I chose that I wanted to reach anyone anywhere in the world. I wanted to spend $50 per day. Each new follower was worth between $0.50 - $2.50. I decided not to do any promoted tweets as I feel that most of what I tweet about is just randomness. Here are the results of running the promoted account. My $50 lasted less then 24 hours, I spent a total of $60.15. Twitter successfully gained $10.15 from me. I gained 54 new followers. I felt that most of my new followers had some common interest. Here is a screenshot of the results from twitter.</p>
