<h2>This grapefruit is for you</h2>

<p>As most of  everyone knows my kid brother has recently had a successful liver transplant. I want to give a little update and  another plea.</p>
<p>First I want to give a little back story. Jake Kennedy was a healthy 21 year old young man. He was in excellent health and worked out almost everyday. Out of nowhere Jake felt real sick, the next day we find out that he needs a new liver or he will die. Fucking scary! Not just for him, but just the ideology of someone having the possibility of dying out of nowhere and so young. As of now Jake is recovering very well. You can read all about the story over at his blog <a href="http://mrkennedy.org">Mr. Kennedy</a></p>
<p>Please be a volunteer donor.  I have been once since I received my drivers license. I never thought about it much until this happen. If it wasn't for some wonderful person that was a donor to lose their life, Jake would be gone too. I am asking for you to please be a donor. It does not take much time and I will be more than happy to answer any questions.</p>
<p>To anyone asking, the title is based off the fact that Jake will never drink alcohol and the fact he will never be able to have grapefruit juice again. Small loss for being able to put a smile on almost everyones face. I love you Jake.</p>
