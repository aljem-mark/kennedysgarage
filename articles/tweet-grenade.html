<p>So I had this thought when I saw companies trying to send out marketing tweets and they end up becoming more or less spam. Often you will see companies asking their followers to re-tweet a message that you end up seeing a hundred times that day. This is what we would call a TweetGrenade or we could make it into a hashtag #TweetGrenade. </p>
