<h2>UX Idea: Elevator Buttons</h2>

<p>I have a confession to make. I am that asshole that accidentally pushes the wrong button more often then I would like to admit. Whether it is the up/down buttons or somehow the wrong floor. I hate myself when I do it and I fell like a complete idiot.</p>
<p>A simple solution for a simple mistake. You push the button to select your choice, why can't you just push it again to unselect your choice. </p>
