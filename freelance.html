<h3>Testimonial</h3>
<p>&ldquo; Over the past 18 months, working with Kennedy to transform kevinandersonmusic.com from an idea into a reality has been nothing short of extraordinary.  When I first met Kennedy, I had very little knowledge of web design or web marketing; I knew it was important to provide a professional image in order to attract the attention of new visitors, & I knew my site had to be hip yet functional in order to convert these visitor’s into fans.  By studying the websites of other artists I began to develop a more clear understanding of the task at hand, and to say the least I was intimidated at first.  But Kennedy was there to talk me through my moments of uncertainty; he spent hours on the phone with me; listening to my concerns, breaking things down, and sharing his own thoughts & insights.  As his rough sketches turned to functional pages, Kennedy’s brilliance as a design artist began to take form; and before long kevinandersonmusic.com had surpassed even my own expectations.  Today, I continue to get compliments from fans, industry executives, and marketing professionals about how functional, sleek, & professional my website is. </p>
<p>In today’s fast paced world, I think it’s incredibly rare to get much more beyond what you’ve paid for; to have someone recognize your needs & treat your product as if it were his/her own.  But that’s what Christopher Kennedy is all about.  I consider myself to be very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Kennedy & I’m certain his other clients would agree. &rdquo;</p>
