        <h2>Kevin Anderson Music <a href="http://kevinandersonmusic.com/">&#9875;</a></h2>
        <p>This was a fun project for me. I enjoyed listening to his music, we started talking, then I built a site for him. The site is capable of selling products, listening to his music, downloading ring tones and self promotion.</p>
