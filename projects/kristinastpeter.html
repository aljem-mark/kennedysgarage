          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>Kristina worked for me at <a href="/projects/grade-spotter">Grade Spotter</a> as our Public Relations Coordinator. As a graduation gift I decided to build her a website to help look for a job out West. She is now happily living and working in California.</p>

          <h3>Website</h3>
          <p>The website is pretty dead simple. It was build to be her r&eacute;sum&eacute; online and give a way for others to contact her. It is responsive and looks great on mobile and tablet devices too.</p>
