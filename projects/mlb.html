          <ul>
            <li><i class="ss-icon ss-standard">&#x2713;</i> Marketing Producer <!-- Who the fuck are we kidding, shit title for a glorified secretary. --></li>
            <li><i class="ss-icon ss-standard">&#x2713;</i> Designer</li>

          <p>The largest site that I have had a chance to work on. Ranked #98 with over 9,000,000 Unique Visitors &amp; 270,000,000 Page Views. It feels pretty good to be trusted with that many loyal fans.</p>
          <!-- Not the highlight of my career, but it was my first job when I moved to NYC. On the average day I was more or less a glorified secretary for a particular team. I really don't have much to show for the year I was there :( -->
          <h3>MLB Fan Club</h3>
          <p>I was tasked with designing and building all the MLB Fan Clubs for each team. These where some of the first pages on the MLB website that used CSS3.</p>
