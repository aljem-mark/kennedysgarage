          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>Night Gator was built on the idea of having a "one stop shop" for Gainesville Drink Specials. A place where Gainesville residents and students could instantly access where Gainesville's best drink specials were and on which night of the week.</p>

          <p>This one of my first site that I ever built that made a profit. This site paid for many drinks and a few dinners. I created it because I wanted a quick way to find the cheapest drinks around town. I started the site in 2008 and sold it in 2013. This was also the <mark>first company I ever sold</mark>. I am no way associated or have anything to do with the new Night Gator.</p>
          <h3>Website</h3>
          <p>The website was pretty simple. There was a little JavaScript that would load that days drink special.</p>
