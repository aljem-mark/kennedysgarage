          <p>The man behind Quinn's Voice is <a href="/projects/djkevinquinn">Kevin Quinn</a>. I first heard that voice of an angle when he ran a morning show on at a radio station. Once I started sketching out and playing around with this brand I knew exactly what I wanted to do.</p>
          <p>It had to be in the shape of a coffee mug. Supper smooth with bold lines. I figured that others could relate to this and the idea is endless. I played around with adding a "V" into it, but it just didn't work out. Sometimes less is more.</p>
          <p>I create this little animation to help paint a better picture of what I had in mind with it.</p>
