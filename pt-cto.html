      <p>Hello, my name is Kennedy and I have an amazing opportunity for small companies and startups. I will be your part-time Chief Technology Officer with the availability for full time dedication. Is your company growing and itâ€™s starting to get out of hand on the technical side of things? Are you bootstrapping and have a limited budget? I am only taking on a limited amount of companies <mark>I only have two spots left</mark>.</p>
      <p>Once we get to know each other and decide to move forward, I will help establish a roadmap and set goals for success. The first week working together will be dedicated to setting up shop ( organizing Github, communicating with your team of designers and developers ) making sure we have a solid foundation to build upon.

    <h3>The benefits</h3>
    <p>What more could you ask for? To sweeten the deal, included in the PT CTO position, your company will also have an additional member to assist, Brian, my business partner. Brian is a business management graduate who can help you strategize your marketing and business development plans.</p>

    <h3>How much you ask?</h3>
    <p>For only $1,000 a week I will give you and your company 10 hours of my time. 8 hours of that will be a dedicated full day and the other 2 hours will be reserved for meetings and emails throughout the week. To get us off on the right track and to make sure we are building off a solid foundation, I will need an entire week setting everything up which will cost $5,000. If additional time is required I can provide that too for a small hourly based reduced price of $100/hr.</p>
